# 🗑️ Smart Auto-Sorting Bin with In-Built Composting

A smart waste bin that automatically classifies waste into **bio-waste**, **e-waste**, and **dry recyclables** (paper + plastic), and even **starts composting** by dispensing microbes — all without human input.

Built for the **DigiGreen Ideathon 2025**, this project focuses on sustainability, automation, and real-world usability.

## 💡 Big Idea Statement

> “A bin that senses, sorts, and starts composting — all before you walk away.”

---

## 🧩 Features

- 🤖 **Sensor-based classification** of waste  
- 🔁 **Rotating lid system** routes waste into 3 internal bins  
- 🦠 **Microbe dispenser** starts composting for bio-waste  
- 🧴 Combines **paper + plastic as dry recyclables** for simpler sorting  
- 🧼 **Fan + charcoal filter** to reduce odor  
- 📦 Compact, modular, and fully autonomous

## 📌 Problem Worth Solving

❌ Most households do not properly segregate waste  
❌ Manual sorting is time-consuming, unsafe, and inaccurate  
❌ E-waste and compostables often end up in landfills  
✅ A smart, sensor-based bin can solve all this at the **source**

## ⚙️ How It Works

```text
1. Waste is dropped into the top inlet
2. Sensors detect:
   - High moisture → Bio-waste
   - Metal → E-waste
   - Else → Dry recyclables (paper/plastic)
3. Rotating lid aligns with the correct chamber
4. Bio chamber receives microbes for composting
5. Lid seals + fan activates to reduce odor
